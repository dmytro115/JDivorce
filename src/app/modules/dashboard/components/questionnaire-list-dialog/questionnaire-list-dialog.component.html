      Everything you print and <strong><i>file</i></strong> at the courthouse will be public record. This means that someone can look up your filed documents by
      typing in your name on a computer in the courthouse, or even internet. There are some exceptions, such as filing medical records under seal.

      If you are the victim of domestic violence, then you are the <strong><i>"Petitioner"</i></strong
      >. The person you want protection from and are filing against is the <strong><i>â€œRespondent"</i></strong
      >. The respondent will be given a copy of all the documents you are filing for domestic violence.
    </li>
    <li>
      The filing and outcome of a request for a Domestic Violence Protection Order can have ramifications on other legal proceedings such as family law. Please
